## Run locally

Open `public/index.html` in a browser (the bot check is skipped when opened from disk), or serve the folder:

```
cd public
python -m http.server 8080
```

## Tests

The maths lives in `public/assets/js/calc.js`. Its tests need only Node 18 or newer, run from the repo root:

## How it is hosted

GitHub Pages, for free. Every push to `main` publishes `public/` (see `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).
Because the user site [mdism.github.io](https://github.com/mdism/mdism.github.io) has the custom domain tools.shaikhismail.com,
this repo appears at https://tools.shaikhismail.com/gst-emi-calculator/ automatically.

One-time, in this repo on GitHub:

1. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.**
2. **About (gear icon on the repo page) → Topics:** add `shaikhismail-tool`. That is what puts the tool on the landing page.

The repo name is the URL path, so keep it as `gst-emi-calculator`.

## Privacy and security

Nothing is uploaded, saved or tracked: see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) (also published as `privacy.html`) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Releasing

The version shows in the footer and links to CHANGELOG.md. Before each release:

```
python scripts/bump_version.py 1.4.0 "What changed"
```
